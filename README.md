# Pac-Man Search
## Authors: Zergio, Tyler, Michael


## Question 1: Depth First Search

The Pacman board will show an overlay of the states explored, and the order in which they were explored (brighter red means earlier exploration). Is the exploration order what you would have expected? Does Pacman actually go to all the explored squares on his way to the goal?
